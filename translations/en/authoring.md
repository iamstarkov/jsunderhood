# For authors

It's easy and funny to be the author.

## What I will get?

* New followers
* Feedback for your ideas
* Share your experience and get advice from more experienced people
* New folks, new ideas 
* Completely new and interested experience
* Write with less restrictions — it's not your very own private twitter.
* Tecnical and common questions people to hesitate to ask you in the your twitter
* It's kinda competition with other authors: we're observing your activity [here](#)
* Respects and fun xD

##Do I have to prepare a plan for my week?

— Tl;DR: Yep. From our experince, better to have the plan. Not exactly detailed plan,
but  the list of themes you're going to discuss. The planning is good both for you
and for the followers.


## Will I be annoyed to answer to questions?

— Sometimes, of course. But communication is most important and most interested part
of the idea of @jsunderhood. I need to note, here's easy to answer then to post
your very own twits. Of course, don't feed the trolls.

## Which themes are most popular?

— You can try to discuss about something below:


* How to measure developers skills (github, stack overflow, etc)
* How you assess and review sites?
* Interviews
* Open Source
* Developer that impress you (collegues, mentors, bloggers, etc)
* Your work and pet projects
* The future of the frontend (in 5 years, etc)
* Your working place and health themes
* Your working environment: technic, software, .dotfiles, etc.
* Most interested technical problems you've faced.
* How you've come to IT.
* Your carrier and current job
* Your professional and common plans for the future
* Your favorite work experience
* Work/life balance
* Your education and self-development.
* Your commitments
