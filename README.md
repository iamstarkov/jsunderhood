> Collective twitter account for frontend developers with a new author
every week

It’s an interesting Reddit AMA analog, but in twitter and obviously with
new functions. It’s an ability to read and discuss significant
or controversial issues with weekly changing authors.

## Why should I care? Why should I follow you?

— You shouldn’t. Otherwise, you will get a huge amount of pros:

* Critical thinking: every author is unique, that’s why the views you
  will find can be quintessentially different
* Comfort zone: ispeakweb will make you step out of your comfort zone
  in some cases
* New: you will discover new trends, things and people
* "Shuffle mode": it’s like a random song on the radio, you can definitely
  find something, which you most likely would never have found
* Experience: authors can share their experience gained over the years
* Mind shift: authors can show professional insights and new approaches
  that dramatically differ from yours
* You can easily contact the author, ’cause it is two way communication channel
* It’s fun

Feel free to follow [@ispeakweb][isw] on twitter.

## How it works?

— New interesting authors weekly, you read and interact with them.

I promise, that I will choose new authors carefully, but nobody can say for sure
how it will be going in real life with every author. Things do happen, you know.

## Show me more!

— _ispeakweb_ will have a statistics page and summary pages for each author.

## What will I get as an author?

* New followers from your target audience
* Test your ideas: get response from numerous followers
* Test your experience, get advice from somebody more experienced than you
* New people and catchy ideas
* Exciting and completely new experience
* Fewer restrictions as it’s not your private twitter!
* Receive technical and common questions which you would never receive
  in your private twitter.
* It's just an honor
* And fun

###  What should I know before starting my week?

#### Are there any general recommendations?

— Yeah, here they are:

1. To begin with, update the bio, avatar, location and background image. Make
   sure that description contains link to your own account
2. Say hello and introduce yourself briefly in a couple of tweets
   at the beginning
3. Specify your plans for the week in one tweet
4. If it’s possible, make all mentioned above in five minutes to be sure that
   your "intro" tweets will be grouped in timeline
5. If you want to answer, retweet the question first. Then write answers
   as ordinary tweets. If you want, you can include question’s author
   at the end of you answers
6. Say goodbye and show your appreciation to followers at the end

#### Should I have a plan for my week?

— Tl;DR: You should. Experience leads us to conclude that having a plan is better
than not having it. Basically, you don’t need a plan itself — you need
a list of topics you want to discuss. Planning have great positive impact
on followers and authors itself.

#### Will I be annoyed by replying? Isn’t it waste of time?

— In some cases, but communication is the most important and interesting part
of @ispeakweb’s idea. Also, replying is easier than writing original tweets.
And you don’t need to feed the trolls.

#### Are there any popular topics I can discuss with my followers?

— You probably can discuss something from the list:

* Ways to rate other developers (github, stackoverflow etc.)
* Rating and reviewing sites
* Making interviews
* Your attitude to opensource
* Developers, you are inspired of or valuable for you (co-workers,
  great mentors or bloggers)
* Your projects
* Forecast frontend trends in 5 years.
* Your workplace and/or health-related topics
* Your work setup: equipment, programs, .dotfiles and other
* Your most interesting technical challenges
* Your start in Computer Science
* Your career path and current position
* Your professional and common plans for future
* Favorite core value and the way you live it
* Your favorite professional experience
* Work-life balance
* Higher education, self-education and online education
* Your contribution and responsibility as a web developer in the overall
  picture of the world
